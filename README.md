Payment Gateway Integration

This task was done under the Web Development and Designing Internship (GRIP) at the Sparks Foundation by Jeyasree P V

The Spark's Foundation website: https://internship.thesparksfoundation.info/

<!-----------------------------------------------> 

A simple Responsive website where payment gateway is integrated. ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯

There will be a simple donate button on the homepage. On clicking the donate button,
the user will land on the payment page where the user can select the choice of a gateway 
than the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc. ðŸ’¯

Once the payment is done an invoice will be generated and an email will be sent to the user
for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount. ðŸŽ±ðŸŽ±
